   <p>My name is Muhammad Khan. My major is Internet & Information Technology. I'm taking this major because I want to learn programming as it is my passion. I did not have any prior experience with coding, but having to take a full time fall semester helped me a lot with my skills. My favorite course so far has been ET710 where I was building websites as my assignments. However, I am looking forward to learning JavaScript. JavaScript and Python are the two classes that I have been anticipating. I am looking forward to learning programming and thinking about coming up with algorithms. My ultimate goal is to get a career as a developer or a programmer. And I want to pursue my bachelors degree by taking part time classes after I am done with my associate.</p>
